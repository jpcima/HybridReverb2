The goal of this project is to keep the HybridReverb2 project maintained and fix the issues.  
The original 2009 page is [archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20200127211945/http://www.ika.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/HybridReverb2/) and the research paper is available [A VST Reverberation Effect Plugin Based on Synthetic Room Impulse Responses](http://dafx.de/paper-archive/2009/papers/paper_48.pdf).

## Introduction

(quoted from the original project page)

> HybridReverb2 is a convolution-based reverberation effect which combines the superior sound quality of a convolution reverb with the tuning capability of a feedback delay network. The sound quality of a convolution reverb depends on the quality of the used room impulse responses. HybridReverb2 comes with a set of room impulse responses which were synthesized with tinyAVE, an auralization software which was developed at the Institute of Communication Acoustics, Ruhr-Universität Bochum (Borß and Martin, 2009; Borß, 2009a). These room impulse responses are designed for a speaker setup with two front and two rear speakers (Borß, 2009b). For a full surround sound effect, you will need two plugins, one plugin which uses a "front" preset for the front channels and a second plugin which uses the corresponding "rear" preset for the rear channels.

## Building

A CMake build file is provided to Linux users for the ability to build LV2 and cross-compile.  
The traditional Juce build process has build files for all platforms in the `Builds` folder. It supports all formats except LV2.

To perform a CMake-based build:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```
